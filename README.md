# Barbell-Velocity-Tracker
A compact, BLE-enabled smart barbell collar for velocity-based training (VBT). The system captures barbell motion with an IMU, computes rep-level metrics on-device, and streams results to a mobile app in real time. Built as part of my Electronics Engineering project and packaged here for reproducible builds and future development.
